<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I guess we'll start with the basics! My name is obviously Erika Debelis. I was born in New Hampshire and didn't move out to Portland until 2018. I roadtripped over with my sister, Michelle; we each loaded up our cars to the brim. Over the course of 9 days we travelled across the country, on our way to our new lives and escaping the northeast coast and the annual 6 months of winter.</p>
  <p>I went to college for a few years straight out of highschool but didn't have a clear path in mind so when i had completed all of my gen-ed courses i hit somewhat of a wall on how to move forward. This prompted me to put my education on pause until I could get inspired by a career path to pursue. In the interim, I had several jobs that helped me realize some important things about me and my strong suits. I learned that I tend to enjoy the technical work much more than any customer service type role I preform. I worked at a hotel that used a DOS-based interface and picked up on the functionality much quicker than others and where others would get frustrated by the interface I was intrigued. Eventually I ended up working as an insurance underwriter and I eventually came to terms with how unfullfilled I felt in the field and work I was doing and decided it was time to unpause my education and career exploration. I had always excelled in math and eventually in my research of local schools and programs stumbled upon Epicodus. I feel more hopeful and engaged in this first week than I have felt in quite a long time and I am super excited to see what the future hold for me.</p>
  <p>My current interests are kind of all over the board. I am actually a NH-licensed makeup artist/esthetician so I have a huge passion for skincare, makeup, drag. I recently bought some rollerblades in an attempt to find something fun outside to do with my friends during covid that was good exercise but so far when I put them on I'm just focused on my falling and hurting myself. The pandemic has also pushed my to cook more at home and I have been getting really into it. I have made homemade carnitas, tomatillo-jalapeno salsa, japanese fritters, grand-mariner+cardamom french toast to name a few. </p>
