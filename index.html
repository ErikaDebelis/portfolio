<h3 class="centered-text">About Me</h3>
  <div class="box2">
    <p>I guess we'll start with the basics! My name is obviously Erika Debelis. I was born in New Hampshire and didn't move out to Portland until 2018. I roadtripped over with my sister, Michelle; we each loaded up each of our cars all the way to the brim and said <span class="intense">'Adios'</span>. Over the course of 9 days we travelled across the country, on our way to our new lives and escaping the northeast coast and the <strong class="emphasize"> 6 months</strong> of winter every year.</p>
    <p>I went to college for a few years straight out of high school but didn't have a clear path in mind so when I had completed all of my gen-ed courses I hit somewhat of a wall on how to move forward. This prompted me to put my education on pause until I could get inspired by a career path to pursue. In the interim, I had several jobs that helped me realize some important things about me and my strong suits. I learned that I tend to enjoy the technical work much more than any customer service type role I preform. I worked at a hotel that used a DOS operating system and interface and picked up on the functionality much quicker than others. Where others would tend to get frustrated by the interface; I was intrigued. Eventually I ended up working as an insurance underwriter and over time came to terms with how unfullfilled I felt in the field. The work I was doing was often negative by nature IE: <span class="intense">denying coverage for a new home because of the type of plumbing used, discussing rate increases, non-renewing insureds due to a expensive losses or DUI noted on motor vehicle reports, etc.</span>. It became clear to me that I needed to make a change to find more positivity in my work so I decided it was time to unpause my education and career exploration. I have always excelled in math and eventually in my research of local schools career options/programs stumbled upon <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/portland">Epicodus</a>. I feel more hopeful and engaged in this first week than I have felt in a long time and I am super excited to see what the future hold for me.</p>
    <p>My current interests are kind of all over the board. I am actually a NH-licensed makeup artist/esthetician so I have a huge passion for skincare, makeup, drag. I recently bought some rollerblades in an attempt to find something fun to do outside with my friends during covid. I figure its good exercise and fun at the same time, but so far I'm just focusing on not falling and hurting myself. The pandemic has also pushed my to cook more at home and I have been getting really into it. I have made homemade carnitas, tomatillo-jalapeno salsa, japanese fritters, grand-mariner+cardamom french toast to name a few. </p>
